The program will be most effective when using two pages that are two or three pages apart (for example, "apple" and "banana"). Pages that are further apart than that may lead to the algorithm going on a tangent.

In all honesty, this version of the algorithm does not seem to improve upon the original version. This was my first time working with AI models in my code, and there was a large degree of trial and error involved. Regardless of whether or not the final product is effective, I did learn an immense amount about how natural language processing models function. I feel like I now comprehend how an algorithm like this is supposed to work (i.e., the theory of how it operates), even if I was not ultimately able to create a functioning piece of software.
